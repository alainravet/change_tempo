Change Tempo
============

NOTE: use http://podshifter.com/ - it's much easier than this.

Increase the tempo of all tracks in the 'Podcasts' playlist in iTunes
(update state is stored in the mp3 'comments' tag, and already altered tracks
will not be re-fiddled, so running this multiple times shouldn't hurt)

=== Dependencies:

* sudo port install soundtouch id3lib ruby rb-rubygems
** (you can get MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/, which'll make the port command work)
* sudo gem install activesupport rb-appscript

=== Install:

Put this somewhere sensible (like ~/bin/change_tempo) and run it regularly, by, say:
  crontab -e
  15 3 * * * ~/bin/change_tempo --speedup 20 --playlist new-podcasts > ~/log/change_tempo.log
